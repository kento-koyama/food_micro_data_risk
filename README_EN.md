## Organizing Information for Digital Exposure Assessment

**Exposure assessment** refers to estimating the number of bacteria ingested by humans through food.  
Continuous accumulation of scientific data is essential for effective risk assessment in Japan.  
This page summarizes foodborne bacterial contamination surveys in Japan since 2000.  
Over the next five years, we aim to build a comprehensive database to further clarify the status of contamination.

The main data needed for exposure assessment are as follows:

| Coverage | Elements | 
| --- | --- |
| Japan | Microbial contamination rate and concentration, consumption amount and frequency, temperature history in food processing and distribution |
| Worldwide | Microbial growth and inactivation rates, variation of these rates within microbial species |

## 1. Foodborne Bacterial Contamination in Japan

### 1.1. Proportion of Positive/Negative Samples

## 2. Food Consumption Amount (Japan)
To estimate what and how much food each person eats per meal, several food consumption surveys have been conducted:
- FY2006: International Medical Information Center Foundation, ‚ÄúReport on the Survey for Collection of Information on Food Health Impact Assessment concerning Foodborne Microorganisms in Foods.‚Äù

---

## 3. Temperature History (Japan)
- To account for the time-dependent environmental changes affecting raw materials, data should cover pre-processing storage, processing, post-processing storage, distribution, and retail.
- Since microbial growth and inactivation follow exponential dynamics, it is important to record temperature changes over time, not just the average temperature.

---

## 4. Prediction of Bacterial Growth/Inactivation Over Time (Worldwide)
Estimating the growth and inactivation of bacterial populations is an important part of exposure assessment.  
ComBase database: https://www.combase.cc  
- Target organisms: Listeria, Salmonella, etc.  
- Parameters: Temperature, water activity (aw), pH

---

## 5. Integration of Data for Dose-Response Assessment
To estimate infection and illness probability from the number of ingested microorganisms, the following information is necessary:
- Since human challenge studies for foodborne microorganisms cannot be conducted, data are collected with this ethical limitation in mind.
- It is necessary to establish a basis for collecting data on ingested microorganism numbers and concentrations.
- Sensitivity to infection and illness can vary by age, sex, genetic background, microbiome, and other factors. These factors should also be considered in data collection.
